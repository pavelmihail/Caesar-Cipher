### Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting text files. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features:

* Encrypts and decrypts text files using the Caesar cipher.
* Allows customization of the shift amount for encryption and decryption.
* Reads input from a file and writes the result to another file.
## Usage:

1. Clone the Repository:

```git clone https://github.com/pavelmihail/Caesar-Cypher.git

cd caesar-cipher
```
2. Run the Script:

* Edit the input.txt file with the content you want to encrypt.

* Run the script:

```
python caesar_cipher.py
```
* The encrypted output will be written to encrypted_output.txt.

* The decrypted output will be written to decrypted_output.txt.

3. Customize Shift Amount:

* Adjust the shift_amount variable in the script to change the level of encryption.
## Example:

For example, with the input text:

```
Hello, World!
```
And a shift amount of 3, the encrypted output will be:

```
Khoor, Zruog!
```
And decrypting the encrypted output will yield the original text.
